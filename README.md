# GuitarSite

---

Welcome to one of my very first projects! Decided to place this project here to show where I started and how far i've come. 

My idea was to build a mock product page for a guitar that I love to play, the Taylor GS Mini Mahogany.

This was built when I was first starting to learn HTML and CSS, which was hard for me to fully grasp at the time.

A lot was learned from this and even though it doesn't look or function properly, I still look back at it as humble beginnings.
