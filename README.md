# Guitar Site V1

This repo contains my old guitar site I attempted when I was first starting to learn Web Development! It is pretty terrible, but it was what I could do at the time with my skills. 

To see an updated version of my guitar site, navigate to my GuitarSite-Redesign repo from my profile, or just [click this link](https://github.com/Jayden-Doll/GuitarSite-Redesign).
